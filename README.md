# Password Generator

## My Task

This week’s homework required me to modify starter code to create an application that enables employees to generate random passwords based on criteria that they’ve selected. This app runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that I've written. It has a responsive user interface that adapts to multiple screen sizes.

## Process and Strategy

This project was tackled by creating global objects and functions that were all utilised in a single large function associated with the 'Generate Password' button. The process and reasoning behind the way the code is written can be read in the comments on script.js.
